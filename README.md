# Coldwell Banker Data Processing

## Project Overview

The Coldwell Banker Data Processing project involves the extraction, transformation, and analysis of real estate data from various sources. The primary goal is to organize and prepare the data for integration into the Coldwell Banker system, ensuring accuracy and consistency. The script performs tasks such as cleaning data, mapping values, and generating Excel sheets for further review and upload.

## Tools and Technologies Used

1. **Python:** The entire project is implemented using the Python programming language for its efficiency in data processing and manipulation.

2. **Pandas:** Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library, is utilized for handling and organizing the real estate data. It streamlines the process of cleaning, transforming, and exporting data.

3. **Excel:** The project exports processed data into Excel sheets, facilitating easy review and integration into the Coldwell Banker system.

## Key Features and Functionality

1. **Data Cleaning:** The script removes unnecessary rows, handles missing values, and identifies critical errors in the real estate data.

2. **Mapping Values:** Utilizing mapping dictionaries, the script translates and standardizes values for consistency and compatibility with the Coldwell Banker system.

3. **Excel Sheet Generation:** The project generates multiple Excel sheets, including unit information, project details, down payments, starting prices, and error logs. Each sheet serves a specific purpose in the Coldwell Banker data integration process.

4. **Project Comparison:** The script compares new projects with existing ones, updating project names based on predefined mapping.

## Conclusion

The Coldwell Banker Data Processing project demonstrates the power of Python and data manipulation libraries in organizing and preparing real estate data for integration into the Coldwell Banker system. By cleaning data, mapping values, and generating Excel sheets, the script ensures that the data is accurate and follows Coldwell Banker's standards. This project is an essential step in maintaining data integrity and consistency within the Coldwell Banker real estate database.

## Limitations

- The analysis may be affected by the quality and completeness of the input data.
- Users are encouraged to review exported Excel sheets and consider potential discrepancies introduced during data processing.
